# Learn Nansen AI 

This is a tutorial wiki for Nansen AI. I will cover some simple tutorials to help users to get started with basic functionalities of Nansen AI. The most popular features are as follows:

- Token Screener 
- Smart Money 
- Token God Mode (Spot and Perps)

## Workflow 

The tutorials will be avaiable to the public as Github Pages. The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a `docs/` folder in the root directory of the repository. 
2. Use the `docs/` folder pattern and enable GitHub Pages publishing from main/docs.   
3. Keep my first version simple: home page (index.md), Getting Started, FAQ, major topics. Don’t over-engineer yet. A getting-started outline is as follows:

```
index.md
getting-started.md 
tutotials/
    token-screener.md
    smart-money.md
    token-god-mode.md 
faq.md
```
4. Use links between pages to build wiki-style interconnectivity (e.g., “See tutorials → token-screener”).
5. Pick a documentation theme (for example Jekyll + “Just the Docs” theme) for clean navigation and sidebar.
