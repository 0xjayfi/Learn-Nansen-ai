## Overview

The Token Screener is a powerful discovery tool that helps you identify tokens based on on-chain signals, smart money activity, and market metrics. It's your gateway to finding opportunities before they become mainstream.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Filtering** - 50+ on-chain and market metrics
- **Smart Money Signals** - Track institutional accumulation
- **Real-time Updates** - Live data refresh every few minutes
- **Custom Screeners** - Save your filter combinations
- **Export Capabilities** - Download results for further analysis

## Getting Started

### Accessing Token Screener

1. Log into your Nansen account
2. Navigate to **Discover** → **Token Screener**
3. Select your preferred blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)

### Understanding the Interface

The Token Screener interface consists of:

- **Filter Panel** (Left) - All available filtering options
- **Results Table** (Center) - Tokens matching your criteria
- **Quick Stats** (Top) - Summary of filtered results
- **Save/Export** (Top Right) - Save screens and export data

## Core Filters Explained

### 1. Smart Money Metrics

**Smart Money Net Flow**
- Tracks net buying/selling by smart money addresses
- Positive = Accumulation, Negative = Distribution
- Time frames: 24h, 7d, 30d

**Smart Money Holdings**
- Percentage of supply held by smart money
- Higher percentage indicates institutional confidence
- Compare against historical averages

**First Mover Score**
- Identifies tokens being accumulated before price movements
- Based on smart money timing analysis
- Higher scores = Earlier accumulation phase

### 2. Market Metrics

**Market Cap**
- Filter by token size (Micro, Small, Mid, Large cap)
- Useful for risk/reward profiling
- Combine with volume for liquidity assessment

**Volume Changes**
- Spot unusual trading activity
- Filter by % change over different periods
- Look for volume preceding price movements

**Price Performance**
- Returns over various timeframes
- Useful for momentum strategies
- Combine with on-chain metrics for confirmation

### 3. On-Chain Metrics

**Active Addresses**
- Number of unique addresses transacting
- Growth indicates increasing adoption
- Decline may signal reduced interest

**Transaction Count**
- Total number of transactions
- High activity often precedes price movements
- Compare against historical baselines

**Exchange Flow**
- Net flow to/from centralized exchanges
- Outflows (negative) = Accumulation
- Inflows (positive) = Potential selling pressure

## Creating Your First Screen

### Example 1: Finding Smart Money Accumulation

1. **Set Smart Money Filters:**
   - Smart Money Net Flow (7d) > $1M
   - Smart Money Holdings > 5%
   - First Mover Score > 70

2. **Add Market Context:**
   - Market Cap: $10M - $500M
   - Volume (24h) > $500K
   - Price Change (7d) < 50%

3. **Apply On-Chain Confirmation:**
   - Active Addresses (7d change) > 10%
   - Exchange Net Flow (7d) < 0

4. **Review Results:**
   - Sort by Smart Money Net Flow
   - Click tokens for detailed analysis
   - Save promising tokens to watchlist

### Example 2: Identifying Oversold Opportunities

1. **Price Action Filters:**
   - Price Change (30d) < -30%
   - Price from ATH < -50%

2. **Smart Money Divergence:**
   - Smart Money Net Flow (7d) > 0
   - Smart Money Holdings increasing

3. **Fundamental Strength:**
   - Active Addresses stable or growing
   - Transaction count maintained
   - Market Cap > $50M (for liquidity)

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Multiple Signals

**The Convergence Strategy**
1. Smart Money accumulation +
2. Increasing on-chain activity +
3. Stable or rising holder count =
4. High probability setup

**The Divergence Play**
1. Price declining +
2. Smart Money accumulating +
3. Exchange outflows =
4. Potential reversal opportunity

### Custom Screener Creation

1. **Build Your Filter Set**
   - Start with broad criteria
   - Gradually narrow based on results
   - Test across different market conditions

2. **Save Your Screener**
   - Click "Save Screen" after applying filters
   - Name it descriptively (e.g., "SM Accumulation Zone")
   - Set notification preferences

3. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Track performance of filtered tokens
   - Adjust thresholds based on outcomes
   - Document successful combinations

## Interpreting Results

### Reading the Results Table

Each row shows:
- **Token Symbol/Name** - Click for Token God Mode
- **Price & Change** - Current price and period changes
- **Market Cap** - Total valuation
- **Volume** - 24h trading volume
- **Smart Money Metrics** - Net flow and holdings
- **On-Chain Metrics** - Key activity indicators

### Sorting Strategies

**By Smart Money Flow**
- Identifies current accumulation targets
- Best for following institutional money

**By First Mover Score**
- Finds early-stage opportunities
- Higher risk, higher potential reward

**By Volume Change**
- Spots unusual activity
- Often precedes major moves

## Common Patterns to Watch

### 1. The Accumulation Pattern
- Smart money inflows over multiple days
- Stable or increasing price
- Growing active addresses
- Exchange outflows

### 2. The Distribution Pattern
- Smart money outflows
- High volume on price rises
- Decreasing active addresses
- Exchange inflows

### 3. The Breakout Setup
- Consolidating price
- Increasing smart money holdings
- Rising on-chain activity
- Volume expansion beginning

## Tips and Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Start with fewer filters and add gradually
- ✅ Cross-reference with Token God Mode for deep dives
- ✅ Save successful screener configurations
- ✅ Monitor saved screens regularly
- ✅ Combine on-chain and market metrics

### Don'ts
- ❌ Over-filter (may miss opportunities)
- ❌ Rely on single metrics
- ❌ Ignore market conditions
- ❌ Chase extreme movements
- ❌ Forget to verify liquidity

## Troubleshooting

**No results showing?**
- Broaden your filter criteria
- Check if filters are conflicting
- Ensure correct chain is selected

**Too many results?**
- Add more specific filters
- Narrow market cap range
- Include smart money criteria

**Data seems outdated?**
- Refresh the page
- Check last update timestamp
- Verify your connection

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Find Hidden Gems
Create a screener to find:
- Tokens under $100M market cap
- With positive smart money flow (7d)
- And increasing active addresses

### Exercise 2: Spot Rotation
Build a filter for:
- Large cap tokens (>$1B)
- With smart money accumulation
- But negative 7d price performance

### Exercise 3: Early Detection
Design a screener for:
- First Mover Score > 80
- Market cap $10M-$50M
- Volume increasing >100% (24h)
